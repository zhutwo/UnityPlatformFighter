NOTES:

- Aerial drift can be affected by holding down a direction
- A long press of the jump button produces a full hop
- If the jump button is released before character exits jump windup, a short hop is produced
- Double jump trajectory is affected by held direction at input
- Pressing down after apex of jump causes character to fast fall
- Landing lag is affected by rate of descent (light and hard landing)

- Release version will have cooldowns as determined by balance testing
